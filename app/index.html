When I filed the EEO-1 report,
a consolidated report was created when I filed for each location.
Is there a consolidated cpmpany report for the Vets 100A as well?
<br>Answer: There isn't a consolidated report (for the entire company)
for Vets 100a filing. The EEO-1 filing is slightly different from Vets.
<br>Should US expats working abroad or foreign hires working in the US on a
temporary basis be counted on either the 100A or EEO-1 reports?</p><p class="post-message-header">Answer:</p><p>US expats should not be reported since they work physically outside
of the US. Temp employees should be excluded as well. <br>If a recently
separated vet is hired, when 36 months from the date of discharge
pass, do you still count them as a recently separated vet or do you
change their veteran status? <br>Answer: They should not be counted as a
recently separated veteran. Please see FAQ:
